  This is a page that <strong>provides <u>English newspapers</u></strong>. I wanted to write it in Korean,
  but I am very sad because this program does not recognize Korean.
  So You must read this page in English. I'm sorry.
  However, there is a lot of useful information on this page, so please read all the articles.
  I believe in Suji and Sumin's English skill.^^ Please read all my comments and leave comments.
  It was too late to know how to write in Korean. But if you write Korean and English together,
  the page is not pretty, so I think you should keep writing in English.
  I hope my friends who read my article first can make a page in Korean.

  <p>I have to write a tag to change the paragraph, but I don't have a sentence to write it.
    But when I tried to write, I couldn't say anything.
    I'll just use it as I can think of it. I came to Suncheon from Seoul and am studying this while eating green tea latte at the cafe.
    I think I'm kind of cool. I think I'm going to stop using it because I'm going to have a certain amount. See you later.</p>
